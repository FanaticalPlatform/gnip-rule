When submitting pull requests, please do the following to make it easier to incorporate your changes:

* Include unit and/or functional specs that validate changes you're making.
* Rebase your changes onto the HEAD of my fork if you can do so cleanly.
* If submitting additional functionality, provide an example of how to use it.
* Please keep code style consistent with surrounding code.

## Testing
You can run all tests by simply running `bundle exec rake test` from your favorite shell.
